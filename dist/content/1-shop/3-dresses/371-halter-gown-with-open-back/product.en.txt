Description: A halter gown is styled with several cutouts on  the sides and back. The architectural design of the dress is the main style of the silhouette. The open lower back, sides, and shoulders are flirtatious and fun. The beaded bodice is covered with colorful beads that also trim the midriff. The form fitting skirt flows to the floor.
