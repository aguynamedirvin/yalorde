Description: An open backed gown is sexy and chic. The straps of the back are adorned with beading and they embellish the front of the bodice as well. The high neckline is beaded as well and the rhinestones create floral and lined patterns. A belted look trims the waistline and separates the bodice from the floor length sweeping skirt.
